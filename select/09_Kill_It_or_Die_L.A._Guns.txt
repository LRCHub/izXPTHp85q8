Tips have lost downtown
I'm awake, I'm held down
Dirty kids don't lie
Can't escape the camera eye
Mess that you've become, bang bang
Whatcha gonna give, no thanks
Pick it all up, take your talk away
I don't got time for the games you're playing now

Feel like I'm eight feet tall
Got the power, I'll wreck them over, yeah
Explode like a panic attack, 'till you last give it a try
You'll never take me down alive

Kill it or die
Kill it

Get your calls speak low down
I'll be coming back renown
You've be working nine to nine
I'll be going all the time
Later I'm lost today
If you have, it's fine, you're doing great
Too far gone to the words I say
I got a little bit of lip too late

Now I feel like I'm eight feet tall
Got the power of a wrecking ball
Explode like a panic attack, 'till you last give it a try
You'll never take me down alive

Kill it or die
Kill it

Baby you're gonna get what you own
Yeah, rock now

Kill it or die
Kill it or die
