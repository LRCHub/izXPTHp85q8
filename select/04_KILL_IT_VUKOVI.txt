The thunder to my lightning
Come hear me cry if it's hell you seek
Soaking in memories but I need to dry
Gone the days when I was young,  ooh
The innocence is truly gone
Lost it all to you
Don't wait too long before you go
So close to touch, I'll make you choke
I wanna war, I got my sticks and stones
(Fire, fire, fire)
Come way too far to cast away my bones
(Fire, fire, fire)
The thunder to my lightning
Don't feel your blows but I hear you breathe
Sucking the life from me
You're a friend and foe
Gone the days when I was young, ooh
The innocence is truly gone
Gave it all to you
Don't wait too long before you go
(I'm your enemy, purging over me)
I'm so close to touch, I'll make you choke
(I'm your reverie, but I think you like it)
I wanna war, I got my sticks and stones
(Fire, fire, fire)
Come way too far to cast away my bones
(Fire, fire, fire)
Too scared to fall asleep when I'm alone
Loose lips sink all the dreams I had on hold
I'm in the clouds, it's heavy
Dark and cold
I'm praying for the rain to take me home
Don't wait too long before you go
(I'm your enemy, purging over me)
I'm so close to touch, I'll make you choke
(I'm your reverie) kill it
War, I got my sticks and stones
(Fire, fire, fire)
Come way too far to cast away my bones
(Fire, fire, fire)
Don't wait too long before you go
I'm so close to touch, I'll make you choke
