I stayed on the phone saying nothing
I thought I could change your mind with mine
You laughed at the though and said it's over
Guess it's true that with you and me I'm always wrong and all you wanna' do is

Kill it cut it down, kill it cut it down
I was amazed you, amazed you would
Kill it cut it down, Kill it cut it down
Used to amaze you, amaze you and now you're through

There's a small black pit I've thrown you into
I save it for, for things just like this
But it's all in vain cause' I know you're down there
All alone with my tossed out thoughts hoping one will spark so you can build it up, build
It up to

Kill It cut it down...
